# Deliverable 4

## Functionalities
This deliverable focuses primarily on three main functionalities: venue, user and reviews. As a bonus, an admin functionality was included. 

## Sample login details
Email: test@test.com

Password: test1234


## Functionality 1: User
One of the main features within StudySpot is the ability for users to quickly and securely ***register and sign*** in to StudySpot. 
When the user first registers and account, their password is hashed using bCrypt and then saved into the user database. 
Aside from that, user authentication is implemented; for instance, if a non-authenticated user in attempts to log into the profile dashboard, they get redirected back to the login. 
If a non-admin user attempts to access the admin page, it redirects them to the home page. If the user tries to access an unknown page, it returns a 404 error page with a warning.

Within the user profile displays the user's details (name, email, bio, and avatar) as well as as well as the userâ€™s bookmarks, reviews, and STUDYSPOT points. 
Users can edit their profile details, change or delete their avatars, delete their account, and remove bookmarked venues.
